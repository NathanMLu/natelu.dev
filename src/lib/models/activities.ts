From the age of 11, I started using drones to capture digital images for mapping my various locations in California and Texas. My images have been utilized by a digital mapping service, Soar (USA), making me the youngest drone pilot and photographer to achieve this feat. In addition, I utilized stitching algorithms and GPS to map images together and create large scale maps used by users across the world.'
